## Introduction

Simulated Annealing (SA) is a metaheuristic optimisation technique using stochastic changes to problem instances to find an optimal or near-optimal solution. SA has been used 
effectively to solve the CVRP, however, only little research exists on how SA fares at solving the SDCVRP. Here, a case study using data from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake 
is used to plug the gap in research. Specifically, data from the ravaged Nurdağı province is used.
