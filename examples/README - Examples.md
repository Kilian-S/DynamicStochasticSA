## Introduction

This section showcases some examples that have influenced the development of the SDCVRP SA algorithm. Additionally, it provides a simple example input data set that can be used 
to test the basic functionality of the SA algorithm.

## SA Example

This code was sourced from Jason Brownlee at [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/simulated-annealing-from-scratch-in-python/).

## Static CVRP Example
